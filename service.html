          <h3>Handling the listing</h3>
          <p>If you’re someone who is not computer savvy and would prefer to spend less time sitting in front of a screen managing your listing – you can ask your co-host to handle the online side of the business. They can be the ones responsible for communicating with guests and sending check-in information to them ahead of their arrival.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="testimonial bg-primary">
            <h3>Checking the space</h3>
            <p>A co-host can be a good way of double-checking things inside the property – whether it’s the cleanliness of the bathroom or whether more clean tea towels are needed in the kitchen. They can also help you create a house manual.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="testimonial bg-primary">
            <h3>Greeting guests</h3>
            <p>Some hosts work full-time jobs and do not have the flexibility to meet guests at various hours of the day to hand over the keys and welcome them to a property. A co-host can handle the meeting/greeting – letting you get on with your day job without interruptions. This can also include handling problems with the property during the stay and liaising with guests.</p>
